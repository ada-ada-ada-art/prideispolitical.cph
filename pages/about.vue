        <h2>About PRIDE IS POLITICAL</h2>
        <p>PRIDE IS POLITICAL is a network for pride events in Copenhagen that believe in international solidarity, justice and universal human rights.</p>
        <p>Pride has over the years been commodified and made into a marketing strategy for corporations with questionable agendas. With the protests being replaced with rainbow parties, the acceptance of our queer lives became conditional on staying apolitical and palpable to a heteronormative society.</p>
        <p>Let’s get back to our roots. Let’s demand liberation for ourselves and others around the world. Let’s insist on pride being political.</p>
        <p>PRIDE IS POLITICAL will promote events that share our values of queer liberation for all. We believe in a community based on solidarity, justice and universal human rights, and want all the community organising efforts to be visible and accessible to everyone.</p>
        <p>Send us your events, big and small, and we will promote them.</p>
        <p>All we ask is that you share our hope for a just and equal future.</p>
